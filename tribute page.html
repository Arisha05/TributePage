        <h3>A Tribute to Vikram Sarabhai - Father of Indian Space Program on successful launch of Chandrayaan-3 on moon.
        </h3>

        <p>Dr.Sarabhai is considered as the Father of the Indian space program; He was a great institution builder and
            established or helped to establish a large number of institutions in diverse fields. He was instrumental in
            establishing the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in Ahmedabad : after returning from Cambridge to an
            independent India in 1947, he persuaded charitable trusts controlled by his family and friends to endow a
            research institution near home in Ahmedabad. Thus, Vikram Sarabhai founded the Physical Research Laboratory
            (PRL) in Ahmedabad on November 11, 1947. He was only 28 at that time. Sarabhai was a creator and cultivator
            of institutions and PRL was the first step in that direction. Vikram Sarabhai served of PRL from 1966-1971.
            He was also Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. He along with other Ahmedabad-based industrialists
            played a major role in the creation of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.
        </p>
        <h4>Indian Space Program</h4>
        <p>The establishment of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) was one of his greatest achievements. He
            successfully convinced the government of the importance of a space programme for a developing country like
            India after the Russian Sputnik launch. Dr. Vikram Sarabhai emphasized the importance of a space program in
            his quote:
        </p>
        <p>"There are some who question the relevance of space activities in a developing nation. To us, there is no
            ambiguity of purpose. We do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically advanced nations in the
            exploration of the moon or the planets or manned space-flight.
            But we are convinced that if we are to play a meaningful role nationally, and in the community of nations,
            we must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to the real problems of man and
            society."</p>
        <p>Dr. Sarabhai started a project for the fabrication and launch of an Indian Satellite. As a result, the first
            Indian satellite, Aryabhata, was put in orbit in 1975 from a Russian Cosmodrome.</p>

        <p>Dr.Sarabhai was very interested in science education and founded a Community Science Centre at Ahmedabad in
            1966. Today, the Centre is called the Vikram Sarabhai Community Science Centre</p>

        <p>Dr.Vikram Sarabhai was born on 12 August 1919 in the city of Ahmedabad, Gujarat State in western India. The
            Sarabhai family was an important and rich Jain business family. His father Ambalal Sarabhai was an affluent
            industrialist and owned many mills in Gujarat. Vikram Sarabhai was one of the eight children of Ambalal and
            Sarla Devi.</p>
        <p>Sarabhai matriculated from the Gujarat College in Ahmedabad after passing the Intermediate Science
            examination</p>
        <p>After that he moved to England and joined the St. John's College, University of Cambridge. He received the
            Tripos in Natural Sciences from Cambridge in 1940.</p>
        <p>With the escalation of the Second World War, Sarabhai returned to India and joined the Indian Institute of
            Science in Bangalore and began research in cosmic rays under the guidance of Sir C. V. Raman, a Nobel Prize
            winner.</p>
        <p>He returned to Cambridge after the war in 1945 and was awarded a PhD degree in 1947 for his thesis titled
            Cosmic Ray investigation in Tropical Latitudes.</p>
        <p>Dr. Vikram Sarabhai died on 30 December 1971 at Kovalam, Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala.</p>
